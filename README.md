# 🛡️ Deepfake KYC Buster

Real-time Deepfake Detection System for Secure KYC Verification

## 📌 Overview

Deepfake KYC Buster is an AI-powered system designed to detect deepfake videos during Know Your Customer (KYC) verification processes. It helps banks, fintech platforms, crypto exchanges, and government systems prevent identity fraud by analyzing live video streams and detecting manipulated or synthetic media in real time.

The solution focuses on security, accuracy, and low latency, making it suitable for real-world financial applications.

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🔍 Real-time deepfake detection

* 🎥 Live video stream analysis

* 🧠 AI-based facial and motion analysis

* 🔐 Secure KYC verification

* ⚡ Low-latency processing

* 📊 Confidence score & fraud flagging

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a modular, scalable architecture:

### 1. Video Stream Processor

Captures live video frames

Performs preprocessing (frame extraction, resizing, normalization)

### 2. AI Detection Engine

* Detects facial inconsistencies

* Analyzes eye movement, lip sync, and texture artifacts

* Uses deep learning models to identify deepfakes

### 3. Decision Engine

* Generates a risk score

* Flags suspicious or fake KYC attempts

### 4. KYC Verification Layer

* Integrates with existing KYC workflows

* Approves or rejects verification requests

## 🧠 Technologies Used

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

* Backend: Node.js / Python (Flask or FastAPI)

* AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch

* Computer Vision: OpenCV

* Authentication: Firebase / OAuth

* Database: Firebase Firestore / MongoDB

* Streaming: WebRTC

## 🔐 Security Highlights

* Encrypted video transmission

* Secure authentication flow

* No permanent storage of user video data

* GDPR-friendly and privacy-focused design

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

* 🏦 Banks & NBFCs

* 💳 Fintech Applications
